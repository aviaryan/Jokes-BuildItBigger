## Build It Bigger

A joke telling app.

The starter code for this project can be obtained from the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud867/tree/master/FinalProject).


### Instructions

* In EndPointAsyncTask.java, change the IP address to suit to your emulator. I use genymotion so for me, IP is 10.0.3.2. Default android emulator
has 10.0.2.2 as localhost IP.
* To view ads, set your DeviceId in `free/...../MainActivityFragment.java` or use a physical device instead of an emulator.
* AsyncTest.java is the unit test to check if async tasks are working or not.
